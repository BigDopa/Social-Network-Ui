# Social-Network-Ui
This project's goal was to make a social network that allowed us to grab data from a file and simulate a social network with users and friends list
This part of the code also let us add posts and texts and let us work with polymorphism and Inheritance
This project also utilized the Qt program, which was sort of a intro to UI design. The files that use this are the dmwindow class and interface class
